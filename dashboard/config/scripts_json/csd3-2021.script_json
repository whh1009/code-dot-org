The scaffolding provided by the project guide and the practice they have using it are intended to assist students in scoping their projects and seeing their ideas through to completion. This project is an opportunity to showcase technical skills, but they will also need to collaborate with their partner, provide constructive peer feedback, and repeatedly use the problem solving process as they encounter obstacles along the way. This project should be student-directed whenever possible, and provide an empowering and memorable conclusion to this unit of CS Discoveries.",

Consider allowing students to group based on common interest as each group will be exploring a field of entertainment together.\r\n\r\n**Distribute:** Give each group a copy of the activity guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Entertainment Exploration\r\n\r\nDuring this activity student groups will do some light research into the role that CS and programming play in various fields of entertainment. The primary goal of this activity is to broaden students' perspectives about how programming can be used to make fun or entertaining things. Some of the fields that students could research (such as art, animation, and games) can be directly connected to programs they will write later in this unit, while others may serve more as an inspiration for how the skills that they learn here may be applied in different domains.\r\n\r\n#### Topics\r\n\r\nIn the activity guide there are a number of potential fields for research. These specific fields were chosen to go along with resources that are provided on Code Studio, but you can have students look into other fields if they wish."

How is computer technology changing this field, and what are some of the problems that people are trying to solve with technology?\r\n  * Second, identify some interesting applications of CS or facts to share. What are some cool things that people are doing in this field that make use of CS?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Interesting Information\r\n\r\nOnce groups have learned a bit about how CS is used in their chosen field, they can complete the second page of the activity guide, which asks them to do the following:\r\n\r\n* **What Problem Does It Solve?:** \"Problem\" in this context can be fairly broad. It might be simplifying an otherwise laborious or complex task, doing things that wouldn't otherwise be possible, or any number of things that make this form of entertainment more accessible to end users.\r\n* **How is it an Improvement?:** This could be tightly coupled with the answer to the previous question. Push students to consider how their form of entertainment was created before programming was prevalent.\r\n* **An Interesting Fact or Use:** Share something fun or interesting about how CS is used in this field.\r\n* **An Open Question:** It's likely that students come away with more questions than answers after just some quick research. Encourage them to reflect on what they don't yet know, and what questions they'd still like answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Share:** Give groups a minute each to share their findings.",

The grid we learned about today is one solution to this problem but there are many others that could've worked. In fact, a lot of you probably noticed that the grid in Game Lab is \"flipped\". Computer screens come in all different shapes and sizes, as does the content we show on them. We need to agree on one point where all the content can grow from. Since we read starting at the top left corner, the grid on a computer screen starts at the top left corner as well. There's also the benefit of not having to use any negative numbers to talk about locations on the screen. Don't worry if this flipped grid is a little tricky still. We'll have plenty more time to work on it in coming lessons.",

You do not actually need to call the function yourself.\r\n* The \"frames\" in Game Lab can be thought of as transparency sheets. Unless you draw a background, then all your new shapes or sprites will simply appear on top of your old ones.\r\n* You should only have one draw loop in your program.\r\n"

For example, each of the following is considered `true` in JavaScript when using the `==` operator, but would be `false` using the `===` operator:\r\n\r\n    1 == true;\r\n    \"1\" == true;\r\n    5 == \"5\";\r\n    null == undefined;\r\n    \"\" == false;\r\n\r\nWe use the `==` operator in this course because it's more forgiving, but it's important to be aware that it can sometimes report back truth when you really didn't intend it to (in which case you might want to use the more strict `===` operator)\r\n"

The student chooses the location and the size of each of the squares, and then records the information about the squares in a table. They then switch tables (not drawings) and try to determine whether or not the two sprites are touching based on the width of each sprite and the distance between them.\r\n\r\nThe math to determine whether the sprites are touching is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Subtract the x (or y) positions of the sprites to find the distance between their centers.\r\n2. Divide the width (or height) of each square by 2 to get the distance from the center to the edge.\r\n3. If the distance between the centers of the sprites is greater than the sum of the distances from their centers to their edges, the sprites are not touching.\r\n4. If the distance between the centers of the sprites is equal to the sum of the distances from their centers to their edges, the sprites are barely touching.\r\n5. If the distance between the centers of the sprites is less than the sum of the distances from their centers to their edges, the sprites are overlapping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Circulate**: Support students as they complete the worksheet.  If students are not sure how to determine whether the sprites are touching, encourage them to use one of the ideas on the board. Remind them that they are not being graded on whether they are right or wrong, but on their ability to use the problem-solving process. If any students are finished early, challenge them to find a method that will work for sprites anywhere on the grid, not just on the same line.\r\n\r\n**Share**: After students have all had a chance to test their solutions, ask them to share what they discovered."

This problem would have seemed almost impossible at the beginning of the year.
